Lazarus source code
Version 2.1
09/22/01

I had wanted to spend more time commenting the code and cleaning a few things up, and 
still plan to do so. But there have been a couple of requests for the source so... here
it is in all its ugliness.

The code compiles fine with MSVC 6.0, and should also work with no problems with MSVC 5.0.
I make no guarantees of success with any other compiler. If you insist on lcc, hey that's
your problem, bub :-)

Use to your heart's content any way you see fit, subject to id's original license agreement.

If you use this to make money, it won't be me you need to worry about but somebody with
just a bit more clout. If you *do* use any of this in a publicly-released mod, I'd 
appreciate a link to the Lazarus site, currently http://planetquake.com/lazarus.
