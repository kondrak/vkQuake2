Overview
===
This is the official Quake 2 code v3.21 with Vulkan support and mission packs included. The goal of this project is to maintain as much compatibility as possible with the original game - just pure, vanilla Quake 2 experience as we knew it back in 1997. There are, however, a few notable differences that made the cut for various reasons:

- 1920x1200 screen resolutions have been added
- world colors have been slightly upgraded - the game's original, darker look can be toggled with the `vk_postprocess` console command
- 64-bit support, additional screen resolutions and DPI awareness have been added
- underwater vision effect similar to software renderer has been implemented
- antialiasing and sample shading is now natively supported
- anisotropic filtering toggle has been added
- players can now change texture filtering modes from within the video menu
- mouse acceleration has been disabled
- console contents can be scrolled with a mouse wheel
- HUD elements, menus and console text are now scaled accordingly on higher screen resolutions (can be overridden with the `hudscale` console command)
- viewmodel weapons are no longer hidden when FOV > 90
- Vulkan renderer fixes broken warp texture effect (water, lava, slime) seen in OpenGL
- software renderer has been completely replaced with [KolorSoft 1.1](https://github.com/qbism/Quake2-colored-refsoft) - this adds colored lighting and fixes severe instabilities of the original implementation
- triangle fans have been replaced with indexed triangle lists due to Metal/MoltenVK limitations
- on Linux, sound is now handled by ALSA instead of OSS
- support for OGG/FLAC/MP3/WAV music has been added in addition to standard CD audio
- music volume slider has been added (OGG/FLAC/MP3/WAV only, CD music still plays at full volume as originally intended)
- game menus have been slightly improved
- added Nightmare/Hard+ skill to the game menu
- added the `aimfix` console command, backported from Berserker@Quake2

A more detailed description of the thought process behind this project can be found in my [blog post](https://kondrak.github.io/posts/2020-09-20-porting-quake2-to-vulkan/), where I explain the overall design, how I attacked some of the problems and also how things developed after the initial release.

Building
===
For extra challenge I decided to base vkQuake2 on the original id Software code. Because of this, there are no dependencies on external SDL-like libraries and the entire project is mostly self-contained. This also implies that some of the original bugs could be present.

## Windows
- download and install the latest [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)
- install [Visual Studio Community 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/free-developer-offers-vs) with C++ MFC for build tools and Windows 10 SDK
- open `quake2.sln` and choose the target architecture (x86/x64) - it should build without any additional steps

## Linux
Unfortunately, Linux code for Quake 2 has not aged well and for that reason only the Vulkan renderer is available for use at this time. Build steps assume that Ubuntu is the target distribution:
- install required dependencies:
```
sudo apt install make gcc g++ mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxxf86dga-dev libxxf86vm-dev libasound2-dev libx11-dev libxcb1-dev
```
- Install the latest [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) - the easiest way is to use [LunarG Ubuntu Packages](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#linux) - just follow the instructions and there will be no additional steps required. If you decide for a manual installation, make sure that proper environment variables are set afterwards by adding the following section to your `.bashrc` file (replace SDK version and location with the ones corresponding to your system):
```
export VULKAN_SDK=/home/user/VulkanSDK/1.2.162.1/x86_64
export PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export VK_LAYER_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/etc/explicit_layer.d
```
- make sure your graphics drivers support Vulkan (run `vulkaninfo` to verify) - if not, you can get them with:
```
sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers
```
- enter the `linux` directory and type `make release` or `make debug` depending on which variant you want to build - output binaries will be placed in `linux/releasex64` and `linux/debugx64` subdirectories respectively

## MacOS
- download and extract the latest [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)
- install XCode 10.1 (or later) and add the `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable to Locations/Custom Paths - make it point to the downloaded SDK
- open `macos/vkQuake2.xcworkspace` - it should build without any additional steps
- alternatively, you can compile the game from the command line - modify your `.bash_profile` and add the following entries (replace SDK version and location with the ones corresponding to your system):
```
export VULKAN_SDK=/home/user/VulkanSDK/1.2.162.1
export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=$VULKAN_SDK/macOS/share/vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json
export VK_LAYER_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/macOS/share/vulkan/explicit_layer.d
```
- enter the `macos` directory and run `make release-xcode` or `make debug-xcode` depending on which variant you want to build - output binaries will be placed in `macos/vkQuake2` subdirectory
- it is also possible to build the game with Command Line Developer Tools if you have them installed: enter the `macos` directory and run `make release` or `make debug` - output binaries will be placed in `macos/release` and `macos/debug` subdirectories respectively

This project uses the Vulkan loader bundled with the SDK, rather than directly linking against `MoltenVK.framework`. This is done so that validation layers are available for debugging. Builds have been tested using MacOS 10.14.2.

## FreeBSD
- install required Vulkan packages:
```
pkg install vulkan-tools vulkan-validation-layers
```
- make sure your graphics drivers support Vulkan (run `vulkaninfo` to verify) - if not, you should either update them or find a package that is best suited for your hardware configuration
- enter the `linux` directory and type `make release` or `make debug` depending on which variant you want to build - output binaries will be placed in `linux/releasex64` and `linux/debugx64` subdirectories respectively

## Raspberry Pi 4
Thanks to the effort of [Igalia](https://www.igalia.com/) and their [V3DV Driver](https://blogs.igalia.com/itoral/2020/07/23/v3dv_vulkan_driver_update/), it is possible to compile and run vkQuake2 on Raspberry Pi 4. Same build instructions as for Linux apply.

Running
===
## Windows
The Visual Studio C++ Redistributable is required to run the application: [32-bit](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) or [64-bit](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) depending on the chosen architecture. These are provided automatically if you have Visual Studio installed.

## All platforms
The [release package](https://github.com/kondrak/vkQuake2/releases) comes only with the Quake 2 Demo content to showcase Vulkan functionality. For full experience, copy retail `.pak`, model and video files into the `baseq2` directory and run the executable. For mission packs, copy necessary data to `rogue` ("Ground Zero"), `xatrix` ("The Reckoning") and `zaero` ("Quake II: Zaero") directories respectively. You can then start the game with either `./quake2 +set game rogue`, `./quake2 +set game xatrix` or `./quake2 +set game zaero`.

## Music
This project uses [Miniaudio](https://github.com/dr-soft/miniaudio) for music playback if the original game CD is not available. For standard Quake 2, copy all tracks into the `baseq2/music` directory following the `trackXX.[ogg,flac,mp3,wav]` naming scheme (so track02.ogg, track03.ogg... for OGG files etc.). For "Ground Zero" and "The Reckoning", copy the tracks to `rogue/music` and `xatrix/music` directories respectively. For additional control over the playback, use the `miniaudio [on,off,play [X],loop [X],stop,pause,resume,info]` console command.

Console commands
===

The following commands are available when using the Vulkan renderer:

| Command                 | Action                                                  |

Known Issues
===
- some Intel GPUs may ignore texture filtering settings in video menu if anisotropic filtering is enabled - this is in fact not an issue but rather a result of anisotropic texture filtering being implementation-dependent
